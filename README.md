**GrayScale** was created during week-long [GameBoy Jam](http://jams.gamejolt.io/gbjam3) (in 2014) and ranked #7 between 245 games. I still have lots of ideas for this game so I'm going to keep developing this game further. Adding enemies, more levels, fixing stuff and even making the code more readable. Feel free to fork it, I am open to any pull requests. The code might be messy in some parts (It's been made in a rush) so you may see commits including the "clean-ups".

# GrayScale

Your goal in **GrayScale** is to clear the level of all the slimey colors floating around. You can only do it by **dashing** through!

Dashing can be also used to SMASH any monsters who stand in your way. But be careful where you land, dashing into the void is deadly and you'll also be bouncing around when you dash into the wall.

## Controls

- Arrows or WASD - move your character around
- "X" or "NUM_4" - while holding movement keys - dash nito gievn direction

Protip: before dashing remember to hold your diretion keys before hitting dash key. It's easier to make diagonal dashes like that.

## Enemies

**Gray Cruncher**: big smile with bigger teeth on his face sais it all. He only wants to eat you. 

**Tile Spectre**: sneaky one, hides inside of tiles and will scream out waves of energy when you get close. Cannot be directly attacked, the only way it can die is to tricking him to stepping into the void.

# Trivia

First enemies were named "Gray Spectre" and "Tile Cruncher". Ended up swapping names by advece from Chris. That made a huge naming mess in code and sound files. Mess not included in the latest commits :)
